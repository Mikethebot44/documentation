---

## What this API does

- Submit a batch of field photos.
- Get a spreadsheet-style result that flags likely problems, severity, and which images can be ignored.

## Key concepts

- **Batch**: one submission with many images.
- **Job lifecycle**: queued → running → succeeded | failed | cancelled.
- **Results**: downloadable as CSV, XLSX, or JSON.
- **Model selection**: set by the API key you send.

## When to use it

- Post-survey QA triage.
- Routine site monitoring.
- Compliance or asset inspection pipelines.

## What is not included

- No model training endpoints.
- No human review workflow in the base API.

## Base URL and versioning

- Base URL: `https://api.<yourdomain>.com`
- Version prefix: `/v1/`
- Breaking changes ship under a new version path.

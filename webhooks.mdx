## Why webhooks

Use webhooks to get notified when a batch finishes instead of polling.

## Event types

- `batch.succeeded`
- `batch.failed`
- `batch.cancelled`

## Payload

```json
{
  "event": "batch.succeeded",
  "batch_id": "bat_123",
  "results_url": "https://api.yourdomain.com/v1/batches/bat_123/results?format=csv",
  "created_at": "2024-05-15T12:00:00Z"
}
```

## Security

- HMAC signature header: `X-Signature`
- Signature covers the raw request body plus a timestamp header.
- Reject requests with timestamps older than 5 minutes to limit replay.

## Retries

- Retries use exponential backoff for up to 24 hours.
- You should return `2xx` when you receive and process an event.

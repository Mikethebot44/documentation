## API key headers

- `Authorization: Bearer <api_key>`
- Optional: `X-API-Key: <api_key>`

The key selects your paid custom model and enforces your quotas.

## Security guidance

- Do not embed keys in client-side apps.
- Rotate keys if a key is exposed.

## Auth errors

- 401: missing or invalid key
- 403: key is valid but blocked (quota exceeded or model disabled)
